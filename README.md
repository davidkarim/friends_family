* README - Food Trucks Project

This was a team project for our Friends and Family mid-point presentation at Wyncode. After 4 weeks in the program we were given 4 days to complete our first project. This project is an app to help food truck fans find where the food trucks in the area are based on truck-owner defined schedules. My contributions to this project included the back-end development, database models, and user authentication.

This is a Ruby on Rails app. It is currently live [here](https://localtrucks.herokuapp.com)
